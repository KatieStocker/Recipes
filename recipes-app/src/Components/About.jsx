                <p>Straight to the Recipe was created as a project based on a problem I, and I am sure many other recipe readers, encounter when you just want to find a recipe and not have to scroll through paragraphs and paragraphs of text about the creators life-story.</p>
                <p>This website aims to provide a better presentation of recipes to users, skipping the life-story entirely and going straight to the point by keeping each section simple to find and easy to browse through.</p>

                    <p>A software developer from the North of England looking for ways to improve upon various features in day-to-day use websites or applications.</p>
                    <p>Currently positioned in a Cloud-based DevOps and Innovation role, I have developed skills and knowledge in many areas of the tech world, and I will continue to learn and improve these skills as much as I can with projects such as this one.</p>
